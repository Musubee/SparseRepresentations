# SparseRepresentations
Summer project studying mathematical representations of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In 2018, Kepner et al. studied such representations using Associative Array Algebra on a restricted class of DNNs. I hope to relax those constraints by developing representations for DNNs that use dropout and nonbinary weights.
